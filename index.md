## Differences between blending methods
Depending on how the colors are stored (RGB, HSV/HSB, HSL, ...), the calculation and therefore the result of the blending between two colors is different.

For **HSV/HSB** and **HSL** it's isn't really a blending since the `hue` component doesn't blend only move towards the destination value.

You can currently see three blending results according to the most popular color models: **RGB**, **HSB/HSV** & **HSL**. Since the color model doesn't store a color the same way the blending differ.

The goal (in the future) is to add **CMYK**, **Lab (CIELAB)**, **YPbPr** & **Xyz**.

## Color Models
### RGB
The **RGB** (**R**ed, **G**reen, **B**lue) color model is the most known, and the most used every day. It defines a color space in terms of three components: Red, Green and Blue. Each of them with a value between `0` and `255`.  
The **RGB** color model is an additive one. In other words, Red, Green and Blue values (known as the three primary colors) are combined to reproduce other colors.

### HSB / HSV
The **HSB** (**H**ue, **S**aturation, **B**rightness) color model defines a color space in terms of three constituent components:
 - Hue, the color indice determining the "pure" color base. Ranges from 0째 to 360째 most of the time (sometimes between `0.0` and `1.0`).
 - Saturation, the intensity of the color. Ranges from 0% to 100%, or `0.0` to `1.0` (0 means no color, that's a shade of grey between black and white. 100 means full color).
 - Brightness (or Value) : the brightness of the color. Ranges from 0 to 100%, or `0.0` to `1.0` (0 is always black. Depending on the saturation, 100 may be white or a more or less saturated color).

The **HSB** model is a nonlinear transformation of the RGB color space. In other words, color is not defined as a simple combination (addition/substraction) of primary colors but as a mathematical transformation.

The **HSB** model is also known as the **HSV** (**H**ue, **S**aturation, **V**alue) model.

### HSL
The **HSL** color model also defines a color space in terms of three constituent components:
 - Hue, the color indice determining the "pure" color base. Ranges from 0째 to 360째 most of the time (sometimes between `0.0` and `1.0`).
 - Saturation, the variation of the color depending on the lightness. Ranges from 0% to 100%, or `0.0` to `1.0` (from the center of the *black & white* axis).
 - Lightness (also referred to as Luminance or Luminosity or Intensity). Ranges from 0 to 100%, or `0.0` to `1.0` (from black to white).

**HSL** is similar to **HSB**. The main difference is that **HSL** is symmetrical to lightness and darkness. This means that:
 1. In **HSL**, the Saturation component always goes from fully saturated color to the equivalent gray (in **HSB**, with **B** at maximum, it goes from saturated color to white).
 2. In **HSL**, the Lightness always spans the entire range from black through the chosen hue to white (in **HSB**, the **B** component only goes half that way, from black to the chosen hue).

Often, **HSL** offers a more accurate (even if it's not absolute) color approximation than **HSB**.
