Enter two hex colors code and see the blending results obtained using different color models (**RGB**,  **HSB/HSV** & **HSL**).

## Source Code

The JavaScript `functions` used on the website can be found in [this file](https://github.com/BenSouchet/color-blend/blob/main/assets/js/main.js).

If you want, you can play with the JavaScript functions directly with you browser dev tools, the file isn't minified so it's easy to check and debug.

**Disclaimer**: I know putting all the JS in one big file isn't top, but I haven't found the time yet to cut the file properly into small files (at least three: main one for DOM manipulations, one for color convertions & last one for blending functions).

I also want in the future to remove the call to Google Fonts by putting the font directly into the `assets` folder. Less GAFAM tracking, less loading time.

## Sponsor the project

Want to help this project to get better, bigger, with more features ?  
I have in mind adding **CMYK**, **Lab (CIELAB)**, **YPbPr** & **Xyz** but adding these color models or others features requires development time...

The solution? [Become a sponsor](https://github.com/sponsors/BenSouchet), so I can allocate time to work more on this project ðŸŒŸðŸ’«
